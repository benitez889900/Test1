# EDINBURGH PROPERTY MARKET INSIGHTS
Last year I decided to start a project to study the house prices in Edinburgh. Just having bought my first property and with the market on an upwards trend, I found the process of knowing how much to bid to secure a property quite frustrating. 

My intention was to develop a system that would allow me to monitor, over time, the fluctuation of prices in the different areas of Edinburgh, as well as how much under/over the asking price the properties sell for. In addition to the above, at the time of creating the script I also noticed that I could gain information about the performance of the Estate Agents involved in the sales as this information was available in the listings, so this too was recorded.

  <dt>Some of the insights that this project provides are:</dt>

1. What is the average asking price range by postcode sector (this is to the EHXY Z## level of detail)
2. For each of those sectors, how much over or under the asking price, in average, are properties finally sold for.
1. Which are the most/less popular areas of Edinburgh where properties are being listed for sale.
2. What are the usual range of different Estate Agents listings? Is there a difference?
