# EDINBURGH PROPERTY MARKET INSIGHTS
Last year I decided to start a project to study the house prices in Edinburgh. Just having bought my first property and with the market on an upwards trend, I found the process of knowing how much to bid to secure a property quite frustrating. 

My intention was to develop a system that would allow me to monitor, over time, the fluctuation of prices in the different areas of Edinburgh, as well as how much under/over the asking price the properties sell for. In addition to the above, at the time of creating the script I also noticed that I could gain information about the performance of the Estate Agents involved in the sales as this information was available in the listings, so this too was recorded.

1. What is the average asking price range by postcode sector (this is to the EHXY Z## level of detail)
2. For each of those sectors, how much over or under the asking price, in average, are properties finally sold for.
1. Which are the most/less popular areas of Edinburgh where properties are being listed for sale.
2. What are the usual range of different Estate Agents listings? Is there a difference?
